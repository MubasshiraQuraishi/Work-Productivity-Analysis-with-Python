## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores how **work-from-home (WFH) practices, managerial support, infrastructure quality, collaboration, and experience** influence:

* **Employee Productivity**
* **Operational Efficiency**
* **Employee Well-Being & Job Satisfaction**

Using a real-world structured dataset, the analysis combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and hypothesis testing** to uncover actionable business insights that can guide **modern workforce strategy and organizational decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand how **WFH intensity impacts productivity and efficiency**
* Identify the **optimal hybrid work model**
* Evaluate the impact of **home-office quality and internet infrastructure**
* Measure how **managerial support affects stress and satisfaction**
* Analyze the relationship between **experience and performance**
* Study how **collaboration frequency and meeting load influence outcomes**
* Provide **business-driven recommendations** rather than only statistical results

## 🔬 Analytical Approach

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution analysis
* Correlation studies
* Trend identification across productivity, efficiency, and well-being metrics

### 2️⃣ Visual Analytics

* Trend plots across WFH intensity
* Infrastructure vs performance comparisons
* Collaboration & meetings vs innovation/productivity
* Experience vs multi-dimensional performance analysis

### 3️⃣ Hypothesis Testing

Statistical testing was applied to validate business assumptions related to:

* WFH impact
* Infrastructure quality
* Manager support
* Commute time
* Experience level
* Collaboration frequency

*(Statistical rigor maintained through assumption checks and appropriate test selection.)*

## 📌 Key Business Insights

* **Hybrid work (4 days WFH) delivers peak productivity and efficiency**, outperforming fully remote and mostly in-office models.
* **Good and average home-office setups outperform extreme setups**, indicating diminishing returns beyond functional comfort.
* **Manager support significantly improves job satisfaction**, but does not directly reduce stress — workload design plays a stronger role.
* **7–8 meetings per week produce optimal productivity**, balancing coordination and deep work.
* **Daily collaboration drives the highest innovation**, though satisfaction remains unaffected.
* **Experience boosts performance up to mid-career**, followed by a notable dip — suggesting burnout or role stagnation.
* **Commute time no longer strongly impacts work-life balance**, reinforcing the value of hybrid work models.
